# JS AND CLASSES
Q. Does JS really have classes?
<br>
A. Na thi, na hai
<br>
Chatgpt: Yes, JS does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECAMScript 2015 specification(often referred to as ES6). However, it is important to note that JS is primarily a PROTOTYPE-BASED LANGUAGE(not object oriented), and its classes are primarity syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanism. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages such as Java or C++, but under hood, it works somewhat differently.

## OOP
programming paradigm - style/structure of writing code

## Object
- collection of properties(variables, constants) and methods(functions)
<br>
- toLowerCase()...

## Why to use OOP
kaam to chlra tha
<br>
messy code, no chunks of code reused -> a big problem

## Components of OOP
Object literal - means literally, it is an object {}
<br>
- Constructor function
<br>
- Prototypes
<br>
- Classes
<br>
- Instances (new, this keywords)

## Four Pillars of OOPS
Abstraction - hiding internal details (eg- fetch etc..)
<br>
Encapsulation - wrap up data
<br>
Inheritance - will be discussed in Prototype section
<br>
Polymorphism - many + forms (eg- console etc..)
